# Implementation-of-CNN-for-action-recognition-in-videos
Deep Learning in Computer Vision to build a convolutional neural network with the Keras framework in Python aimed at recognizing actions in videos.  The UCF101 dataset, which is formed by YouTube videos gathered in 101 categories is used to train and test the proposed approach.
